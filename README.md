## Write Up
This project was bootstrapped with React and built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Although this is a SPA that doesn't need much of React's advanced features, I decided to use React because I wanted to customize my own carousel using React's efficient state handling. In addition, React works well with CSS modules, which really helped scope the styling throughout the page.

I struggled figuring out the best way to use a responsive grid layout along with React components. The grid layout was not working as intended due to the way I modularized my javascript files and components. However, I got it to work after taking some time to research more about how CSS grids work internally and tried to incorporate that into my React project structure.

I really enjoyed playing around with the styling and creating my own animations. Also, as much as I struggled with the mobile responsiveness, I actually enjoyed it because it allowed me to figure out new creative ways to approach things. Overall, it was a fun experience.
